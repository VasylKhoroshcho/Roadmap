# Limitations:
### Operating systems limit the number of file descriptors that may be open at any given time so it is critical to close the descriptor when operations are completed. Failure to do so will result in a memory leak that will eventually cause an application to crash.
---
### On Windows, access-control policies (ACLs) on a directory may limit access to a file or directory. The fs.access() function, however, does not check the ACL and therefore may report that a path is accessible even if the ACL restricts the user from reading or writing to it.
---
### The fs.readFile() method asynchronously reads the contents of a file into memory one chunk at a time, allowing the event loop to turn between each chunk. This allows the read operation to have less impact on other activity that may be using the underlying libuv thread pool but means that it will take longer to read a complete file into memory. The additional read overhead can vary broadly on different systems and depends on the type of file being read. If the file type is not a regular file (a pipe for instance) and Node.js is unable to determine an actual file size, each read operation will load on 64 KiB of data. For regular files, each read will process 512 KiB of data.
