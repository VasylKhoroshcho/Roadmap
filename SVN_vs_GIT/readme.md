### GIT VS SVN

- With SVN you only download files that you are working on, with GIT all devs download whole project
- SVN is based on a directory structure, and branches are created as directories inside the repository. When development is done, the changes are committed to the trunk. Git branches are only references to a specific commit, and branches can be created, edited, or deleted anytime without affecting the underlying commit.
